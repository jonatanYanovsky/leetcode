# leetcode-Solutions
My solutions to LeetCode problems, starting from the top of https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/

I hope that creating this repository will show my competency in data structures and algorithms. 
I attempt to write clean, easy-to-follow code. However, I haven't included many comments, for the reason that these are small, "one-use-only" programs. As such, these would not be included in a larger program which would require adequate comments/explanations/documentation.

C++ only! 
In addition, I favor using the data structures built into the C++ STL: map, forward\_list, etc...
I use these instead of using the data structures that LeetCode provides in their problems.

Some solutions include multiple methods to solve a problem: O(n^2), O(nlog(n))
